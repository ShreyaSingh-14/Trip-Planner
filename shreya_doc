this file is here for documentation.
I will write a lot here so sit back enjoy popcorn and read this while you are here with this dox.
i will be writing this very informally. why? coz I want to. For this project at least.

30-07-25:
so what happened is once we make a new react app for this we run
npx create-expo-app@latest trip-planner
the next thing happened is i can see the dependencies loading but they were shown deprecated so the ts version is old...it has to be above 5.0 for this to be fixed...

now what?
we remove these files, 
get that version now again run the same npx command and see those dependencies loading,
now if you see any thing like red folder and it ways some expo folder is not found in tsconfig.json then
nothing to worry just close vs code and open it again.
why? coz it takes time for vs to digest this new version of ts you just loaded a min ago..
yah we will reopen it and this time everything will be in place.
