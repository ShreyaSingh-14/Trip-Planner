Hey Cheetah!!!

yayyay I've started working too!!!

05-08-25
Kicked off with the signup page.
Layout? Done. Input fields? Done. Go Back button? …yeah, still on vacation.
Stopped at 55:42, feeling pretty good until I realized tomorrow-I will have to finish what today I avoided.

Two wins today.
    -Splash Screen (23:22 → 36:17) — finally made it look less like a default template and more like an actual app intro. Smooth transitions too.
    -Signup Page (51:53 → 58:21) — wrapped it up completely. No more “half-finished form” vibes.
    -Both working fine — no explosions, no mysterious red errors. A rare peaceful day in dev land.

Today was bug-fighting day.
    -MyTrip: Finally remembered to invite useState to the party (React was getting lonely). Swapped out mystery colors for proper constants and untangled some wild JSX brackets. Synced it with the new _layout, made sure trip data shows up without throwing tantrums, and gave the styling a quick comb.
    -StartNewTripCard: Same color drama here—fixed. Added TouchableOpacity so buttons actually do something when tapped. Cleaned up the file so it no longer looks like it was written five minutes before a deadline. Alignment and spacing now play nicely with the rest of the app.
    -_layout: Gave the main navigation a proper cleaning—organized screens, ditched useless code, and made sure routing doesn’t get lost.
Result: Both components now behave, look consistent, and work smoothly in the app. Console is quiet… almost too quiet.

Traveler Picker Day!!!
    -SelectTraveler: Built the whole “Who’s Travelling?” screen. Users can now choose between Just Me, Couple, Family, or Friends—complete with cute little icons (because visuals matter). Hooked it into CreateTripContext so the choice actually saves instead of just looking pretty. Header styling and padding tuned for a clean look.
    -Options.js: Created a tidy little list of travel party types with titles, descriptions, icons, and people counts. Basically, the “menu” for the traveler picker.
    -OptionCard: Made each option look like a proper card. Highlighting now works when selected (so users know what they picked instead of guessing). Borders change, colors match the app theme, and everything feels consistent.
Result: The app now politely asks “Who’s Travelling?” and remembers your answer. No more planning trips into the void.

Today was Budget & Review all selection day!!!
    -We added a Budget screen so travelers can choose whether they’re going all-out luxury or keeping it low-budget. It’s tied into the trip details, and if someone tries to skip it, they get a cheeky toast saying, “Nope, pick one.”
    -Once a budget is picked, the Continue button wakes up and takes you to the new Review Trip screen. That screen neatly shows your destination, dates, number of travelers, and budget. There’s also a big “Make My Trip” button so you can lock it all in.
    -Basically, now the app makes sure you decide your spending style before packing your virtual bags.

Built the whole profile page layout today. Added a profile image, name, email, and an Edit Profile button. Also set up menu sections for Settings, Trips, and Support with their own list items and icons. Styling is in place so it looks clean and organized.
Right now, it’s just the skeleton — the buttons and links are ready but they don’t lead anywhere yet. Navigation will be added later to make it fully functional.
