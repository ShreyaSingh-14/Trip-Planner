Hey Cheetah!!!

yayyay I've started working too!!!

Kicked off with the signup page.
Layout? Done. Input fields? Done. Go Back button? …yeah, still on vacation.
Stopped at 55:42, feeling pretty good until I realized tomorrow-I will have to finish what today I avoided.

Two wins today.
    -Splash Screen (23:22 → 36:17) — finally made it look less like a default template and more like an actual app intro. Smooth transitions too.
    -Signup Page (51:53 → 58:21) — wrapped it up completely. No more “half-finished form” vibes.
    -Both working fine — no explosions, no mysterious red errors. A rare peaceful day in dev land.

Today was bug-fighting day.
    -MyTrip: Finally remembered to invite useState to the party (React was getting lonely). Swapped out mystery colors for proper constants and untangled some wild JSX brackets. Synced it with the new _layout, made sure trip data shows up without throwing tantrums, and gave the styling a quick comb.
    -StartNewTripCard: Same color drama here—fixed. Added TouchableOpacity so buttons actually do something when tapped. Cleaned up the file so it no longer looks like it was written five minutes before a deadline. Alignment and spacing now play nicely with the rest of the app.
    -_layout: Gave the main navigation a proper cleaning—organized screens, ditched useless code, and made sure routing doesn’t get lost.
Result: Both components now behave, look consistent, and work smoothly in the app. Console is quiet… almost too quiet.
