Heyy,
So for today, I got a couple of things done:
  * Wrapped up the splash screen (23:22 → 36:17) — it’s set up, styled, and transitions are working.
  * Finished the entire signup page (51:53 → 58:21) — layout, input fields, and basic styling all done.
*Both are up and running now, so we can start linking them or adding the extra stuff next.
