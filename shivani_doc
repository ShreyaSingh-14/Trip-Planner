Hey Cheetah!!!

yayyay I've started working too!!!

Kicked off with the signup page.
Layout? Done. Input fields? Done. Go Back button? …yeah, still on vacation.
Stopped at 55:42, feeling pretty good until I realized tomorrow-I will have to finish what today I avoided.

Two wins today.
  -Splash Screen (23:22 → 36:17) — finally made it look less like a default template and more like an actual app intro. Smooth transitions too.
  -Signup Page (51:53 → 58:21) — wrapped it up completely. No more “half-finished form” vibes.
  -Both working fine — no explosions, no mysterious red errors. A rare peaceful day in dev land.

Today was bug-fighting day.
  -Worked on MyTrip and StartNewTripCard, but they started throwing errors before I even blinked.
  -In MyTrip, I forgot to import useState (React was definitely judging me). Tried using a color that didn’t exist, and my JSX looked like it had been attacked by mismatched brackets. Fixed all that, used a proper color from constants, and got the conditions to work right.
  -StartNewTripCard had the same color problem and was missing TouchableOpacity. That’s why tapping stuff felt like tapping a photo. Fixed that and cleaned the whole file so it didn’t look like it was written during a coffee rush.
By the end, both components actually worked, no red errors, no angry console messages — just sweet, calm compilation.
